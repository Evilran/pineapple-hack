# Description

Pineapple Lang is a simple programming language demo. It includes a hand-written recursive descent parser and a simple interpreter, although the language is not even Turing-complete. But this repo's main goal is to give beginners of compilation principles a warm up and a simple look at how a programming language is built.

**This project is a Hack Lang implementation of Pineapple Lang**


# How to run
